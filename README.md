# COVID-19 Policy Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the effectiveness of lockdown policies across different states in Brazil, India, and the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using geospatial visualization and correlation analysis, we investigate how policy stringency influenced health outcomes.

## Data Sources
- **COVID-19 Policy Data:** Sourced from [Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/covid-19-government-response-tracker).
- **Geospatial Data:**
  - India: [GADM](https://gadm.org/) / OpenStreetMap extracts
  - Brazil: [IBGE](https://www.ibge.gov.br/en/) / OpenStreetMap extracts
  - USA: [Census Bureau Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html)

## Visualizations
- Heatmaps displaying containment health index by state for Brazil and India.
